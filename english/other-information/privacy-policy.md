## User rights

You can refuse to track any type of bot event, including privileged intents, if you refuse them, expect problems such as if you refuse Server Members Intent, then when you log on to any server, the bot will not be able to track you and therefore you may not get an auto role.

## Presence Intent

{% hint style="info" %}
The bot will be able to track your activity.

This is necessary for the economy, logs, as well as some commands.

The server owner may request a waiver of this intention.
{% endhint %}

## Member Content Intent

{% hint style="info" %}
The bot will be able to track your messages, or rather their content, files and embeds

This is necessary for logs, moderation, ticket archiving, as well as our neural network.

We do not store your messages beyond the discord limit.

For the neural network, we use the following libraries: TensorFlow, NLTK, Gensim. 
We have 2 neural networks: 1. this is the recognition of questions. 2 This is a search for similar questions that managers have recorded
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The server owner can refuse to train a neural network on his server.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The user can refuse to use this Intent, after which he is prohibited from using the bot and is on the same server with it.
{% endhint %}

## Data storage

All saved data is stored on secure servers.

Although storage methods vary, most of the data is stored in password-protected databases such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

Please keep in mind that even with such protection, no data can ever be 100% secure.

Every effort is being made to ensure the safety of your data, but their absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
